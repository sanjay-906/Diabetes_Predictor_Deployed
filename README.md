MODEL   : <a href="https://sanjay-906-diabetes-predictor-deployed-ui-fbxqyx.streamlitapp.com" target="_blank">Click Here</a>


Logistic Regression Algorithm is used to train the model<br>
Model trained with a simple dataset<br>
Model can predict wheather a person has diabetes/ has the chance of getting diabetes based on the input.<br>
UI designed using streamlit module<br>
Model deployed on Streamlit cloud<br>
Model has approx 78% accuracy<br>

INPUT CONTEXT:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant<br>
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br>
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br>
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)<br>
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br>
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br>
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function<br>
Age: Age (years)<br>
